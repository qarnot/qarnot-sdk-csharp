# Version 1.1.1

Version 1.1.1 was released on 2018/01/15.

## Changes in This Release
* Update the UserInformation class to match changes in the Rest Api.

* Change some xApi class public constructors to internal.

* Add a property to retrieve the connection object from a Storage object.

* Add missing comments in the documentation.

* Don't fail to retrieve the bucket list if we can't retrieve the information from one bucket.
